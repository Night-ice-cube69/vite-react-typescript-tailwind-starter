## 📦 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your computer meets these requirements:

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher
- **npm**: Comes with Node.js

If you don’t have Node.js installed, visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

   To get the latest version of the starter template, visit this page to download: [Releases Page](https://github.com/Night-ice-cube69/vite-react-typescript-tailwind-starter/releases).

2. **Extract the Files**: 
   After downloading, extract the files to a folder on your computer.

3. **Open a Terminal**: 
   You will need to navigate to your project folder using the terminal or command prompt.

4. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Once in your project folder, run the following command to install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start the Development Server**: 
   Run this command to start your application:

   ```
   Your app will launch and be available in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 🎨 Customization

### 🖌️ Modify Styles

To change the appearance of your app, you will use Tailwind CSS. Tailwind allows you to add styling classes directly in your HTML. You can find a comprehensive guide on Tailwind CSS [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).

### 📄 Update Components

You can edit and customize the React components available in the `src` folder. Feel free to rename or structure them as needed to fit your project.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

- **Error on Install**: Ensure you have the right version of Node.js and npm installed.
- **Development Server Not Starting**: Check that you ran the command in the correct project directory.
- **Style Not Applying**: Confirm you included the Tailwind CSS file in your project.
